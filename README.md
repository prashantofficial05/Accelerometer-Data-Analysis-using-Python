# Accelerometer-Data-Analysis-using-Python
Accelerometer is a device used to measure the acceleration or vibrations of a motion. The data provided by an accelerometer is three-dimensional and can be used in data-driven applications for solving problems like fall detection and health monitoring. So, if you want to learn how to analyze accelerometer data.
